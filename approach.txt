Ok, here's my approach

- The rocket element is an svg, that just rotates
- The space itself is also svg... because canvas seems too hard to work with right now and it's at least twice the innerwidth and fixed
- Viewport this is an overlay on the space, it moves around, it's the size as the browser Viewport

First let's get this set up.
